# **Executive Summary**

## **Purpose of Cyber Defence Kit**

The main purpose of project **Cyber Defence Kit** is to enhance the cybersecurity infrastructure of our organisation. By researching and implementing cybersecurity tools in a phased approach—starting with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, specifically **Splunk** and **Wazuh**—the project aims to:

- Strengthen cyber defence capabilities
- Integrate advanced cybersecurity tools
- Enhance threat detection and response
- Automate security operations
- Ensure compliance with cybersecurity standards
- Promote a proactive security posture

This phased implementation allows us to focus on establishing a strong foundation with SIEM solutions before gradually introducing additional tools like Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR), Incident Response and Case Management, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR), and Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR).

This project aligns with our strategic goal of protecting our assets and developing a small Security Operations Center (SOC) within our organisation. By integrating these tools and practices gradually, we will enhance our ability to proactively detect, respond to, and mitigate cybersecurity threats.
